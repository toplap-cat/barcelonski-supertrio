# Barcelonski supertrio

The "Barcelonski supertrio" is an audiovisual experience created by veteran electronic musicians and visualistss Iván Paz, Roger Pibernat and Niklas Reppel.
Based in Barcelona, it was formed in Slovenia on the occasion of a concert at Kluže Fortress in 2023. 

Their electronic music integrates elements of post-rock, drone, and ambient, and with the tight integration of the visuals, reminds of 
bands and projects such as Boards of Canada or GY!BE, yet has a very distinct quality due to the way it is created.

All music and visuals are created algorithmically, through the modification of source code live on stage. The code is projected behind the 
performers and lets the audience take a glimpse into the creation process, creating a feeling of live-ness that is otherwise rarely found in 
electronic music.
