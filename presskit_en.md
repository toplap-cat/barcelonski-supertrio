# Barcelonski supertrio

The "Barcelonski supertrio" is an audiovisual experience created by veteran live coders Iván Paz, Roger Pibernat and Niklas Reppel.
While based in Barcelona, it was formed on the occasion of a concert at Kluže Fortress in Slovenia in 2023. 

Their electronic music integrates elements of post-rock, drone, and ambient, and with the tight integration of the visuals, reminds of 
bands and projects such as Boards of Canada or GY!BE, yet has a very distinct quality due to the way it is created.

All music and visuals are created through modification of source code, which is projected behind the performers and 
lets the audience take part in the creation process.
